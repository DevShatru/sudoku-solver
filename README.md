"# sudoku-solver" 

A sudoku application meant to teach children/newcomers how to play Sudoku. The app allows the user to attempt a puzzle from a number of preset or randomly generated puzzles. They can get help from the app, wherein the app reveals the vavlue of one cell, and also the reasoning/logic behind the placement of that value.

The app can show the user two types of elimination:
- No other value fits in a particular cell
- Only one cell in a box/row/column that a particular value fits)

For more complex puzzles, the app will also demonstrate a backtracking algorithm to the user

TODO:
- Highlight selected input value
- Allow Keyboard inputs
- Block selected value on 9 occurences
- Highlight if value occurs multiple times in row/column/box
- Puzzle only says solved if user solution matches app solution
- Better explanations for the computer's logic
